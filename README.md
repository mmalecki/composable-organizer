# Composable Organizer
Composable Organizer is a organizer system made up of compartments of various sizes
that can be joined together, lids and trays.

The unit of sizing is one `u`, `1 u == 20 mm`.
The size of a container is identified by 3 numbers, each describing an axis.
For example `2 x 3 x 1` specifies a compartment of 40 mm x 60 mm x 20 mm outer size.

Wall thickness is 1.2 mm by default. It's adjustable, but containers of varying
wall thickness can't interface with each other.

## Build manual

### Quick build
To quickly print these out, head on over to [TBD printables.com link] (). The 
model contains compartment and lid STLs rendered for all variations of sizes
from 1u - 12u.

### Print settings
* **Material**: Any material. I used Prusament PLA.
* **Brim**: Do use brim for the compartments. The inserts can sometimes fall-over
  when thin walls (as by default) are used.
* **Layer height**: At most 0.2 mm layer height (recommend using [variable layer height](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/variable-layer-height-function_1750)
  with adaptive layer height, which will use different layer height for the
  base and the hinges).
* **Infill**: 15% (unless you customize wall thickness, most of the infill will be
  located inside the bottom wall).
* **Perimeters**: 3

## Customizing
If there's a particular size you need that isn't covered by the available STLs,
you can use OpenSCAD to render it yourself:

```
git clone https://github.com/mmalecki/composable-organizer
cd composable-organizer
./scripts/build <size> # size in the format of `<x>x<y>x<z>`, e.g. `2x3x1`
# `output` directory will contain the built files.
```

(Note: the build script requires GNU Parallel.)

### Customizing even further
The `parameters.scad` file contains several knobs you can tweak to get a more
custom system (e.g. with thicker walls).
